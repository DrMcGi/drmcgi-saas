# Work Plan

- [x] Review key layout files (`src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`) and shared styles (`src/app/globals.css`).
- [x] Audit major UI components for tone, motion, and luxury cues (focus on `Hero`, `BackgroundManager`, `Nav`, `CaseStudies`, `Packages`).
- [x] Draft enhancement concepts and supporting code snippets for a more ultra-premium feel (typography, interactions, copy).
- [x] Share recommendations and snippets with the user for alignment before applying changes.
- [x] Implement couture global design system and typography tokens in `src/app/globals.css`.
- [x] Elevate navigation and hero experience with new structure, ticker, and CTA.
- [x] Introduce new storytelling sections (`SignatureVision`, `ExperienceAtlas`, `GuaranteeSuite`) and integrate into `page.tsx`.
- [x] Refine packages, tiers, and case studies components with luxury card treatments and overlays.
- [x] Reimagine concierge dock and contact flow with premium interactions.
- [x] Update footer to "Private Client Wing" with partner/press exposure.
- [x] Run project lint/tests to verify integrity.
